## Overview
This is a small project that utilizes Flexbox to create a responsive layout in HTML and CSS. In this project, we leverage the capabilities of Flexbox to design and position elements in a flexible and adaptable manner for different devices and screen sizes.

### The Challenge
The challenge was to create a responsive layout using Flexbox CSS to achieve a flexible and adaptable arrangement of elements. The goal was to create a design that automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and provides a consistent user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Screenshot
Here is a screenshot of the project, showcasing the responsive design and the elements arranged using Flexbox CSS.

## My Process
I started by creating the basic structure of the project using HTML.
Next, I applied styles using CSS, making use of Flexbox to position and distribute the elements within the layout.
I performed testing on different screen sizes and made necessary adjustments to achieve a responsive and adaptable design.

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS (Flexbox)

### What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned how to utilize Flexbox CSS to create flexible and responsive layouts. I gained experience in using Flexbox properties and values such as display: flex, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, among others.

### Continued Development
While this project is on a small scale, I plan to continue exploring and learning more about Flexbox and other responsive design techniques. I will also seek to implement additional functionalities and improve the visual appearance of elements in future projects.
