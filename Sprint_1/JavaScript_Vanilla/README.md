## Overview
In this project, I have created a To-Do List using CSS pseudo-elements and DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript. The main goal was to build an application that allows users to add tasks to a list and mark them as completed when needed.

### The Challenge
The challenge involved implementing the following functionalities:

Allowing the user to add new tasks to the list.
Allowing the user to mark tasks as completed.
Allowing the user to delete tasks from the list.

## My Process
In my approach to this project, I followed these steps:

Structured the basic HTML for the task list.
Used CSS to design and style the interface of the To-Do List, including the use of pseudo-elements for list items.
Used vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and add the necessary functionality, such as adding and deleting tasks, and marking them as completed.

### Built With
This project was built using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### What I Learned
During this project, I learned how to use pseudo-elements in CSS to style specific elements of the task list. I also gained experience in manipulating the DOM using vanilla JavaScript and implementing interactive functionalities.

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to improve this project by implementing additional features, such as the ability to edit existing tasks and add categories or labels to tasks.
