## Overview
This is a profile card that displays basic information about a person, such as their image, name, star rating, description, and two buttons for reading more and contacting. The profile card is designed using BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) notation, pseudo-elements, flexbox, and has a responsive design.

### The Challenge
The challenge was to create a visually appealing profile card that presents information clearly and in an organized manner. Additionally, some interactive effects were required, such as button color change on hover and star color change when hovering over them.

## My Process
1.- I structured the HTML of the profile card using BEM notation to maintain a modular and reusable structure.
2.- I applied styles using CSS, utilizing flexbox to achieve a flexible and responsive layout.
3.- I used pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) to add additional details and decorative styles to the profile card.
4.- I implemented the button color change effect by applying specific styles for the hover state (:hover).
5.- I added styles to make the star ratings paint when the user hovers over them.
6.- I performed testing and adjustments to ensure the profile card looks good on different screen sizes and devices.

### Built With
This project was built using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS (BEM notation, pseudo-elements, flexbox)

### What I Learned
During the development of this profile card, I learned how to use BEM notation to structure my CSS code in a more organized and modular way. I also gained knowledge about using pseudo-elements to add additional styles and decorative details to elements. Additionally, I reinforced my skills in using flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to enhance this profile card by implementing smooth animations and adding more interactivity to the buttons and elements of the card. I will also explore different design techniques to create variations and additional styles for profile cards.

### Useful Resources
During the project development, the following resources proved to be useful:

* [MDN CSS Documentation:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS)
* [BEM Notation Guide:](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)
