### The Challenge
The main challenge of this project is to create an interactive rating component that allows users to select a rating and display the result in a modal. Some key aspects to consider are:

* Designing an attractive and user-friendly interface for the rating component.
* Implementing the logic to capture the rating selected by the user.
* Displaying the rating result in a modal in a clear and readable manner.
* Ensuring that the component is responsive and functions correctly across different devices and screen sizes.

## My Process
During the development of this project, I used the following technologies and approaches:

### Built With
This project was built using the following technologies:

* React: I used React as the main library for building the interactive rating component.
* SASS: I used SASS as a CSS preprocessor to write more efficient and reusable styles.

### What I Learned
During the development of this project, I learned how to:

* Create reusable and modular components in React.
* Use SASS to write more advanced and structured styles.
* Implement a modal in React using.

### Continued Development
Although the interactive rating component is functional, there are areas where I would like to continue working on:

* Improve the accessibility of the component to ensure an optimal experience for all users.
* Optimize the performance of the component, especially when it comes to state updates and re-renders.
* Add more customization options to the component, such as changing the number of stars or the modal text.

### Useful Resources
During the project development, the following resources proved to be useful:

* [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs) - An extensive resource for learning React and its various concepts and features.
* [Official SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - A comprehensive documentation resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
